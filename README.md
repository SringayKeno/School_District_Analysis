# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis: Purpose of this analysis

Maria, the Chief Data Scientist for a city school district is tasked with preparing all standardized test data for analysis, reporting and presentation to provide insights about performance, trends and patterns. These insights are used to inform discussions and strategic decisions at the school and district level. I assisted Maria on analyzing data on student funding and students stanardized test scores. I was given access to every students math and reading scores as well as information on the schools they attend. My task was to aggregate the data and showcase the trends in school performance. This analysis will assist the schoolboard and Superintendant in making decisions in regading to school budgets and priorities.


## Results: 

After completion of the first analysis, the school board notified Maria that the students_complete.csv file (one of the files we drew data from) shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board did not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they wanted to uphold state-testing standards and turned to Maria for help. Maria asked to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once replaced I repeated the school district analysis.
